When using the original size document:
1 process: 12.060312
2 processes: 6.446911
4 processes: 6.501472
8 processes: 6.459059
Although we get a big speedup when we make the program run with more than one process,
further increase in the number of processes does not help.
The overhead time gets too big, thus the program is not highly scalable.
