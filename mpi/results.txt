When using the original size document and 20 iterations:
1 process: 12.060312 sec
2 processes: 6.446911 sec
4 processes: 6.501472 sec
8 processes: 6.459059 sec
Although we get a big speedup when we make the program run with more than one process,
further increase in the number of processes does not help.
The overhead time gets too big, thus the program is not highly scalable.

When using the original size document and variable processes and iterations:
1 process, 20 iterations: 12.060312 sec
2 processes, 40 iterations: 12.939465 sec
4 processes, 80 iterations: 24.964695 sec
8 processes, 160 iterations: 50.262990 sec
